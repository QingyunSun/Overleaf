	Abstract = {We propose an evolutionary framework for optimal portfolio growth theory in which investors subject to environmental pressures allocate their wealth between two assets. By considering both absolute wealth and relative wealth between investors, we show that different investor behaviors survive in different environments. When investors maximize their relative wealth, the Kelly criterion is optimal only under certain conditions, which are identified. The initial relative wealth plays a critical role in determining the deviation of optimal behavior from the Kelly criterion regardless of whether the investor is myopic across a single time period or maximizing wealth over an infinite horizon. We relate these results to population genetics, and discuss testable consequences of these findings using experimental evolution.},

@article{mattingley2011receding,
	Annote = {http://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/code_gen_rhc.html

There are 3 versions of the paper (mostly similar), I review the first one (CSM paper) but probably the manuscript is more complete.

Reiterates (as in Fast Model Predictive Control Using Online Optimization - Yang Boyd 2010) on the MPC ideas. This time it cites an alternative way to solve similar problems, that is ``traditional'' linear control systems. I don't know much about those, he cites PID ( proportional-integral-derivative) controllers. I think those linear controllers are good for small simple problems but are bad for anything a bit more involved. 
Again it explains the idea behind explicit MPC, that is solving the control function exactly and thus building sort of a lookup table of inputs to controls, infeasible for big problems (curse of dimensionality). 
This paper follows the Yang Boyd 2010, so it cites it. Actually it cites in the same line of research (MPC online with e.g. interior point) a few papers, the most fitting from the title is ``Application of interior point methods to model predictive control'' 2004. So I'm reframing that paper as simply the test of a few clever little methods to online MPC, nothing revolutionary. However it frames that class of solvers as something that requires hand-customization, i.e. they are not general purpose.

This paper instead is about automatic generation of solvers for MPC problems with linear dynamics, convex per-stage objective, convex constraints and still expected (if the objectives are RV) average cost.

This paper has a cut much more for practitioners than the YangBoyd2010, i.e. it specifies in much more practical terms what the quantities at play actually are. 
It seems that it's generally better than the YB2010 one. For example it explains in more detail the certainty equivalent formulation of MPC, in which for every stage optimization problem you substitute the future unknown quantities with the E[] values and similar stuff. Also it casts in the same framework a model that I thought fundamentally different:
Take T = 0, i.e. MPC with no look ahead, but choose an appropriate terminal cost function. We are basically solving the HJB equation, he calls it ADP or Lyapunov-control. I have to look back at the MS&E 321 stuff. 

Cool thing, we frame CVX: first thing, it is not the only one parser-solver software for convex problems, (look [44]-[46]), there is also YALMIP and CVXMOD (Mattingley, Boyd - discontinued (evolved in cvxpy?) which is kind of the same thing but in python (Mattingley, Boyd). I wonder how it relates to cvxpy. Also the solvers space has more depth that I knew, basically the standard one (used by CVX) is SDPT3, but they also mention SeDuMi.

This paper relies on cvxgen which is a software package mattingley did. It takes a convex problem equivalent to a QP and automatically generates C code for solving it (with no library dependecies!!) or matlab. This paper is probably the main application of cvxgen! He describes the workflow of cvxgen: you don't put in the problem parameters! Only the problem form. It detects simplification, smart matrix factorizations, and produces optimized, nearly branch-free (-> small executable) c code ready to be deployed.

CvxGen
Explains the conceptual differences between CVXGEN and a parser-solver like cvx. The key is that by knowing the problem form it can efficiently choose a KKT matrix factorization and so dramatically speed up online computation. Also it produces C code free of dependencies, and especially for small problems (10s of variables) it allows execution on embedded processors (100k of ram).

Examples
Nice. You manage an inventory of one commodity. The demand for that commodity is a log normal gaussian process, i.e. its logarithm is a gaussian process (normal with given covariances from step to step). That sounds like a standard econometrics assumption for a self-correlated process like demand for a commodity.
You have to meet demand exactly at every time step. You can buy on futures markets at various delays in the future or in the spot market. You first assume that these prices are constant, the spot price is much higher. 
There is a niche of literature on stochastic control policies for this kind of problem. So I assume this paper is about improving the existing solutions to this problem. Or maybe this just one application they study. The conditional expectation of a gaussian process next value is an affine function of the past observations (the number of lags depends on the form of the gaussian process, i.e. there are econometrics test to decide how many lags are significant).

There are 2 other examples really cool: optimizing a CPU to choose how to allocates cycles between jobs (queues of instructions), optimizing the controller of a battery to buy and sell energy on the network at different prices.

In all example he shows the improvements of these models vs. some basic policy.},

We apply dynamic programming to two different trading problems. We introduce a novel trading model that captures the active-versus-passive order tradeoff faced by a broker when benchmarked to VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price). We are able to solve both the case where the stock quantity is discrete and continuous. The solution is in terms of a highly intuitive forward and backward boundary, for which we even obtain closed-form solutions in certain cases. The second problem is the dynamic hedging of an option under an Almgren-Chriss model of market impact. We are able to derive a highly intuitive dynamic solution.},

	Abstract = {Closing prices are important benchmarks of value. Portfolio returns and mutual fund net asset values are computed using closing prices, and some contracts and after-hours trading on various Alternative Trading Systems (ATS) are based on closing prices. But herding by institutional traders can cause large price movements at the close, typically in the same direction as institutional demand. As such, these price movements represent a substantial transaction cost, even to those traders who can trade at closing prices. The authors study the behavior of stock returns at the close across the stocks of the Russell 1000 using 1) transaction-level data, and 2) the complete record of all Market On Close (MOC) order imbalance indications. The authors show that institutional trading interest induces a common component to stock returns at the end of the day. This return phenomenon reflects a higher demand for immediacy, manifested in a larger fraction of nonblock trades and greater price sensitivity to nonblock order flow in the closing period. We find systematic return reversals following imbalance publications at the close, especially on days related to index expirations. This is consistent with our hypothesis that liquidity trading at the close on these days creates transitory price movements that represent a substantial hidden cost to institutions.},

	Abstract = {Price changes over a fixed number of transactions may have a Gaussian distribution. Price changes over a fixed time period may follow a stable Paretian distribution, whose variance is infinite. Since the number of transactions in any time period is random, the above statements are not necessarily in disagreement. A possible explanation is proposed by Taylor, and then shown by Mandelbrot to be intimately related to an earlier discussion of the specialists' function of ensuring the continuity of the market.},
